		<span class="trait-highlight">quiet, composed, and dignified</span>
		individual, often maintaining an air of calm professionalism as Karasuno's volleyball team manager.
		While initially appearing reserved and somewhat distant, she gradually reveals a 
		<span class="trait-highlight">warm, caring nature</span> beneath her serene exterior.

	  <h2 class="background-heading">Background Story</h2>

	  <div class="background-content">
		<div class="timeline-marker">
		  <p><span class="highlight-keyword">Kiyoko Shimizu's journey
		  </span> to becoming Karasuno's beloved team manager began in middle school, 
		  where she was initially a <span class="highlight-keyword">track and field athlete</span>.
		  Despite her natural athleticism, she struggled with <span class="highlight-keyword">
		  social connections</span>, often finding herself isolated from teammates due to her quiet nature. 
		  This experience left her hesitant to engage deeply with others, even after she eventually stepped away
		  from competitive sports.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="character-growth">
		  <p>When she entered <span class="highlight-keyword">Karasuno High School</span>, 
		  she had no intention of joining any club—until 
		  <span class="highlight-keyword">Daichi Sawamura</span>, recognizing her potential,
		  persistently recruited her to become the volleyball team's manager. 
		  Though reluctant at first, Kiyoko accepted the role, marking the beginning of her 
		  <span class="highlight-keyword">transformation</span> from a withdrawn observer 
		  to an integral part of the team.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="timeline-marker">
		  <p>Her early days as manager were marked by the same <span class="highlight-keyword">quiet reserve</span>,
		  but as Karasuno's players—particularly the enthusiastic second-years—earned her trust, she gradually opened up.
		  A pivotal moment came when she recruited <span class="highlight-keyword">Yachi Hitoka</span>
		  as her assistant, forming a close bond that helped her break out of her shell even further.</p>
		</div>

		<p>Over time, Kiyoko's <span class="highlight-keyword">dedication to the team</span>
		became undeniable, whether through her meticulous preparation, her symbolic restoration of Karasuno's old banner,
		or her subtle but impactful encouragement during matches.</p>

		<div class="conclusion">
		  By the series' end, she evolves from a distant figure into a cherished teammate, 
		  eventually marrying Tanaka and remaining connected to the sport that helped her find her place.
		  Her story is one of quiet growth, proving that leadership doesn't always require a loud voice—just a steadfast heart.

	  is marked by subtle yet impactful moments that reveal her growth from a reserved manager to an
	  <span class="moment-highlight">indispensable pillar</span> of Karasuno.</p>

	  <div class="pivotal-moment">
		<p>One of her most significant contributions comes when she

	  as assistant manager becomes a turning point, not just for the team's logistics but for Kiyoko personally, 
	  as their heartwarming friendship helps her overcome social anxieties.</p>

	  <div class="emotional-moment">
		<p>During tense matches, her quiet presence on the sidelines evolves into active encouragement,
		  most notably when she breaks character to <span class="moment-highlight">passionately cheer</span>
		  during Karasuno's showdown with Shiratorizawa.</p>
	  </div>

	  <p>The cultural festival arc showcases her unexpected <span class="moment-highlight">playful side</span>
	  when she dresses in a bear costume, while her graduation speech - delivered with uncharacteristic 
	  emotion - leaves the entire team in tears.</p>

	  <div class="emotional-moment">
		<p>Perhaps most beautifully, her relationship with Tanaka progresses from his comedic admiration to 
		  <span class="moment-highlight">genuine mutual respect</span>, culminating in their marriage post-time skip.</p>
	  </div>

		<p>The third-years (<span class="relationship-highlight">Daichi, Sugawara, and Asahi</span>)
		share a special rapport with her, having witnessed her growth from hesitant first-year to confident manager.</p>
	  </div>

	  <p>Even rival teams recognize her significance, with Date Tech's manager
		<span class="relationship-highlight">Shirofuku Yukie</span> developing a friendly rivalry.
